Users primarily come from search engines, and don't typically browse gov websites for entertainment or joy.
Even this behavior is changing (moving further away from website use), as users interact with GPTs, and never make it to a .gov site for informational queries.

[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) describes how an organization's communication structure impacts the design of its systems and products.
U.S. gov is quite terrible at this, considering how many users have a singular mental model of "Government", yet the web experience is dispersed across more than 5,000 websites (at the federal level alone) -- which is distinct from the 80,000+ other local jurisdictions that tend to also have at least 1 website, on average.

A user-centered perspective quickly reveals the contrast, dissonance, and friction between an individual's mental model between "Gov" and the reality of thousands of websites and hundreds of thousands of pages.

What can be done about this?
Unifying the experience for users would help. This creates pressure to overcome silos and consider a user-centered (rather than agency-centric) experience.

M-23-22 highlights: "Duplicative websites and content can also be problematic because they may cause
public confusion." Thus, approaching websites as products that primarily provide content and or transactional experiences can reinforce the business-level performance goals that should drive gov websites. This can help siloed teams move beyond intermediate internal goals and incentives that reify silos (number of pages published, page views, and other vanity metrics).

The notions of 'front stage' and 'back stage' are known and embraced in [Service Design and Business Process Management](https://github.com/gsa/service-design-analytics).
Generally, silos are back stage considerations. Conway's law implies that silos tend to shape the front stage experiences,
so, organization teams should, at a minimum, be aware of these concepts, before taking action to re-design service delivery approaches based on this awareness.

Importantly, create an environment that helps support a sense of **psychological safety** to:
* shut down websites
* assertively consolidate duplicate content
* move legacy content formats to modern, accessible, semantically structured, discoverable formats (toward html)
* work across silos that might exist due to budgetary colors of money, IT/content management systems, or organizational inertia
* celebrate shared organizational performance goals (even at the expense of sunsetting local, long-lived, legacy efforts)

Finally, tactics to move forward:
* establish a website inventory
* establish a content inventory ([data](https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/#action-6-publish-and-update-data-inventories) is also content)
* ensure page level [analytics](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/) are in place
* instrument event-level analytics where it makes sense (eg: transactions)
* automate scanning for accessibility and identifying duplicate content
* ensure publishing guidance and editorial practices are clear, right-sized, and effective
* adjust team composition (eg: CMS role & content permissions) to align with the value streams services are delivering
* consolidate or adjust systems and their related contracts
